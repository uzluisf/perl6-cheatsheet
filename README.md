# perl6-cheatsheet

Based on [Perl 6 Cheat
Sheet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/perl6/mu/master/docs/Perl6/Cheatsheet/cheatsheet.txt).

Inkscape doesn't export multi-page documents natively. For this reason, each
page for a cheatsheet is provided as a separate svg file. Each page can be
exported as a pdf and then a program like PDF Shuffler can be used to combined
them all into a single pdf file.
